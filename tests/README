A test consists of at least two files: an executable file, named $TEST, and its
expected output, named ${TEST}.out.  If, when $TEST is run, it outputs anything
different from the contents of ${TEST}.out, then it fails.  If a test needs
auxiliary files, they may be put here so long as they are not executable.
